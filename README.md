# IBC v2 Relayer

IBC v2 Relayer is a relaying service for the IBC v2 Protocol. The relayer supports interoperating between a Cosmos-based chain and major EVM networks.

## Relaying Sequence
![Relaying Sequence](./relaying-sequence.png)

## Supported Features

- Compatible with all major EVM chains (Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, and more)
- Request-driven design for configurable, on-demand relaying
- Transaction failure retry support
  - Re-orgs
  - Out-of-gas
  - Inadequate gas price
  - Tx network propagation fails to reach leader
  - Invalid by the network, but valid by the submitting node
- Transaction Tracking API
- Remote signing support
- Configurable packet delivery latency via batching
- Ability to blacklist addresses (ex: OFAC)
- Transaction cost tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- A running [proof API](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/tree/main/programs/relayer) (attestor) service
- RPC endpoints for the chains you want to relay between

### Local Development

1. Start Postgres and run migrations:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Create a local config file (see [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference) below).

3. Create a local keys file (see [Local Signing](#local-signing) below).

4. Run the relayer:
```bash
make relayer-local
```

The relayer will start:
- gRPC API server on the address configured in `relayer_api.address`
- Prometheus metrics server on the configured address
- Relay dispatcher polling for new transfers

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--config` | `./config/local/config.yml` | Path to relayer config file |
| `--eureka-relaying` | `true` | Enable/disable the relay dispatcher |

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

## Design
![Design](./relayer-design.png)

The relayer has three main components - the gRPC server which clients use to interact with the relayer, a postgres db, and the core relayer. The gRPC server populates the db with packets, which the core relayer monitors and updates as it progresses in relaying those packets.

## API Interface
The relayer serves a gRPC server which clients use to specify what packets to relay and track packet relaying progress.

```proto
service RelayerApiService {
    // Relay is used to specify a source tx hash for packets the relayer should relay.
    // The relayer will identify all packets created by the transaction and attempt to relay them all.
    rpc Relay(RelayRequest) returns (RelayResponse) {}

    // The status endpoint is used to track the progress of packet relaying.
    // It takes a transaction hash and returns the status of any relevant packets the relayer is aware of.
    // The transaction must first have been passed to the relay endpoint.
    rpc Status(StatusRequest) returns (StatusResponse) {}
}

message StatusRequest {
    string tx_hash = 1;
    string chain_id = 2;
}

enum TransferState {
    TRANSFER_STATE_UNKNOWN = 0;
    TRANSFER_STATE_PENDING = 1;
    TRANSFER_STATE_COMPLETE = 2;
    TRANSFER_STATE_FAILED = 3;
}

message TransactionInfo {
    string tx_hash = 1;
    string chain_id = 2;
}

message PacketStatus {
    TransferState state = 1;
    uint64 sequence_number = 2;
    string source_client_id = 3;
    TransactionInfo send_tx = 4;
    TransactionInfo recv_tx = 5;
    TransactionInfo ack_tx = 6;
    TransactionInfo timeout_tx = 7;
}

message StatusResponse {
    repeated PacketStatus packet_statuses = 1;
}

message RelayRequest {
    string tx_hash = 1;
    string chain_id = 2;
}

message RelayResponse {}
```

## Signing

The relayer supports two signing modes, configured via the `signing` block in the YAML config. The mode is inferred from which fields are populated:

- If `grpc_address` is set → **remote signing** (ignores `keys_path`)
- Else if `keys_path` is set → **local signing** from key file
- Else → fatal error at startup

### Local Signing

Set `signing.keys_path` to point to a JSON file containing private keys. The format is a map of chain IDs to key objects:

```yaml
signing:
  keys_path: "./config/local/eurekakeys.json"
```

```json
{
  "1": {
    "private_key": "0xabc123..."
  },
  "cosmoshub-4": {
    "private_key": "abc123..."
  }
}
```

For EVM chains, the private key is a hex-encoded ECDSA private key. For Cosmos chains, it is a hex-encoded secp256k1 private key.

### Remote Signing

For production deployments, the relayer can delegate signing to an external gRPC service. This keeps private keys isolated from the relayer process.

#### Configuration

```yaml
signing:
  grpc_address: "signer.internal:50052"
  cosmos_wallet_key: "my-cosmos-wallet"
  evm_wallet_key: "my-evm-wallet"
  svm_wallet_key: "my-svm-wallet"
```

#### Authentication

The remote signer connection uses the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable as a bearer token in gRPC metadata for authenticating requests to the signing service.

#### Signer Service Interface

The remote signer must implement the following gRPC service:

```proto
service SignerService {
    rpc GetChains(GetChainsRequest) returns (GetChainsResponse) {}
    rpc GetWallet(GetWalletRequest) returns (GetWalletResponse) {}
    rpc GetWallets(GetWalletsRequest) returns (GetWalletsResponse) {}
    rpc Sign(SignRequest) returns (SignResponse) {}
}
```

The `Sign` RPC accepts transaction payloads for EVM, Cosmos, and Solana chains and returns the appropriate signature format for each:

- **EVM**: Accepts serialized tx bytes + chain ID, returns `(r, s, v)` signature components
- **Cosmos**: Accepts sign doc bytes, returns a raw signature
- **Solana**: Accepts a base64-encoded transaction, returns a raw signature

The full proto definition is at [`proto/signer/signerservice.proto`](proto/signer/signerservice.proto).

#### Implementing a Compatible Signer Service

To implement your own signer service, refer to the proto file for message formats and signature requirements.

**Methods used by the relayer:**
- `GetWallet` - called at startup to retrieve public keys (uses `Cosmos`, `Ethereum`, and `Solana` pubkey types)
- `Sign` - called for every transaction

**Methods not used by the relayer:**
- `GetChains` - can return an empty response
- `GetWallets` - can return an empty response

**Sign payload types used by the relayer:**
- `EvmTransaction` / `EvmTransactionSignature`
- `CosmosTransaction` / `CosmosTransactionSignature`

**Sign payload types not used by the relayer:**
- `RawMessage` / `RawMessageSignature`
- `SolanaTransaction` / `SolanaTransactionSignature`


**Authentication:** The relayer sends the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable as a bearer token in the `authorization` gRPC metadata header. Validation is optional.
